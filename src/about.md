Corporate style feedback processes can often be cold, invasive, and ultimately unfulfilling. 

Typically feedback gets collected in the form of a _performance review_, which your manager, along with your manager's manger, and you manager's manager's manager (you get the point) have access to, even though it may be something you consider quite personal. 

Further, the possibility that those in positions of power may read this feedback can influence both what the feedback-giver writes and how the feedback-receiver copes with the process as a whole. Reviews can cause anxiety, stress, and fear.

In a sentence: traditional reviews can be awful.

Giving and receiving feedback should be a sincere moment of mutual exchange, support, and learning! Both sides should feel as comfortable and safe as possible while fulfilling their parts.

This site in turn hopes to provide a quick-and-easy means of attracting and receiving sincere, helpful feedback. While ideally such a process would take place in person, for a lot of us that isn't an option. Using this site over a video call however could be a decent alternative.

The feedback process implemented here is inspired by an [amazing post by Chelsea Troy titled Attracting Feedback](https://chelseatroy.com/2018/11/26/leveling-up-skill-14-attracting-feedback/), in which she goes into great detail explaining the benefits of using a goal-based feedback process. 

If you haven't read this post yet, I highly  encourage you to do so before the next time you plan on asking for feedback. Also note, if you're preparing to give feedback, Chelsea has written [other in-depth posts that look at all sides of the feedback process](https://chelseatroy.com/tag/feedback/).
