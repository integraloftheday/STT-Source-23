As CHI 2021 will be virtual, STT21 will be virtual and conducted over Zoom. We will additionally offer attendees access to an STT Discord Server with an #STT21 channel for asynchronous text-based conversation and some social fun. The server will be available beyond STT21 and hopefully used for future events.
