The “Experiencing Smell, Taste, and Temperature Interfaces” workshop addresses the burgeoning subfield of chemo-
and thermo-sensory interfaces (smell, taste, and temperature) as well as their cultural contexts, usage, and resulting
experiences. This two-day, in-person workshop will offer an interdisciplinary forum of discussion for academics and
practitioners interested in leveraging these sensations.
