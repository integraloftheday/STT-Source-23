The “Smell, Taste, and Temperature Interfaces” workshop addresses the burgeoning subfield of chemo- and thermo-sensory interfaces (smell, taste, and temperature) as well as their cultural contexts, usage, and resulting experiences.  This three-day workshop will offer an interdisciplinary forum of discussion for academics and practitioners interested in leveraging these sensations.
