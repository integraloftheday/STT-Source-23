The topics of interest for the workshop include, but are not limited to, the following

* Design and use of multi-sensory technologies.
* Technologies pushing forward smell, taste, and thermal experiences.
* Chemo- and thermo-sensory augmentation.
* Cultural aspects and contexts of multi-sensory interactions in everyday life and history, which influence and shape both the technologies being developed and their societal adoption.
* Techniques & recommendations for recording and stimulating chemo- and thermo-sensations.

We aim to additionally highlight and discuss open challenges in the field, which include, but are not limited to,

* Power consumption: affects all chemo- and thermo-sensory devices, but especially thermo-.
* Chemicals: affects all chemo-sensory devices (smell, taste, chemesthetic), often non-reducible, recordings and replay of experiences, precision, inter- and intra-modality effects (e.g. suppression effects).
* Non-technical: complexity of dimensions, precision, cultural adoption, sharing data across HCI researchers, open sourcing of devices, simultaneously ongoing basic scientific research.
