The topics of interest for the workshop include, but are not limited to, the following:
* Sharing & open-sourcing experimental setups, hardware, or toolkits for smell, taste, and temperature.
* Techniques and methods to design and use multi-sensory technologies.
* Systems for recording, stimulating, and augmenting multi-sensory experiences.
* Assistive and environmental technologies using smell, taste, or temperature.
* Cultural aspects and contexts of multi-sensory interactions in everyday life and history, and how they influence and shape the technologies developed and their societal adoption.

We aim to additionally highlight and discuss open challenges in the field, which include, but are not limited to,
* Recommendations on sharing tacit knowledge.
* Sharing system designs: share how researchers overcome power limitations, wearable form factor constraints, network constraints, and compute resource utilization.
* Tackling the replication of this research: affects all these devices, which end up being often non-reducible, recordings and replay of experiences, precision, inter-, and intra-modality effects.
* Data sharing & modeling: how to share data across HCI researchers, benefit from recommended practices in data modeling, information dissemination, and evaluation methodologies.
* Perception: avoid sensory conflicts or take advantage of mixed senses, calibrate for over or under stimulation, predictably stimulate senses for a large and diverse population of people.
* Social implications: for example, questions around cultural adoption and equal access to these interfaces.
