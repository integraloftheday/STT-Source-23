#### Jas Brooks 
Jas Brooks is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Chicago. Their research
expands the computer interface to engage with the chemical interactions of our bodies and investigates what this
paradigm enables. These chemical interfaces have introduced new input and output methods, such as electrically induced
stereo-smell (directional odor cues), chemically stimulated haptics, and more. Their research is covered in media
publications like WIRED, Fast Company, Digital Trends, and IEEE Spectrum, and supported by a National Science
Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship. Website: [jasbrooks.net](jasbrooks.net)

#### Alireza Bahremand
Alireza Bahremand is a Ph.D. student in the School of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering at Arizona
State University. His research focuses on adaptive software-hardware frameworks for multi-sensory digital embodiment.
Recent works include the Smell Engine, a software-hardware framework that integrates olfactory stimuli into virtual
environments, closely reflecting real-world olfactory sensations. As a contributing researcher to the ASU Dreamscape
Learn partnership, Alireza is working with teams of professors and students to build educational multi-sensory XR
experiences at scale. Website: [alirezabahremand.com](alirezabahremand.com)

#### Pedro Lopes
Pedro Lopes is an Assistant Professor in Computer Science at the University of Chicago. Pedro focuses on integrating
computer interfaces with the human body—exploring the interface paradigm that supersedes wearable computing. Some
of these new integrated devices include: a device based on muscle stimulation that allows users to manipulate tools they
never seen before or that accelerate their reaction time, or a device that leverages the nose to create an illusion of
temperature. Pedro’s work also captured the interest of media, such as New York Times or NewScientist, and was
exhibited at Ars Electronica and the World Economic Forum. Website: [lab.plopes.org](lab.plopes.org)

#### Christy Spackman
Christy Spackman is an Assistant Professor in the School for the Future of Innovation in Society as well as the
Department of Arts, Media, and Engineering at Arizona State University. Her work focuses on how the sensory
experiences of making, consuming, and disposing of food influence and are influenced by “technologies of taste,” oft-
overlooked technologies and practices used to manage the sensory aspects of foods during production. Her current book
uses this framework to examine how scientific and technological innovation changed the taste of water throughout the
20th-century. Christy holds training in molecular biology, food chemistry, and the culinary arts, allowing her to bridge
disciplinary divides in research. Website: [christyspackman.com](christyspackman.com)

#### Judith Amores
Judith Amores is a Research Fellow at the MGH/Harvard Medical School and a Research Affiliate at the MIT Media
Lab, where she did her Ph.D. and master’s and helped run VR/AR at MIT as a co-president. She holds a multimedia
engineering degree and has worked at Microsoft Research, URL Barcelona, and the Google Creative Lab. Her awards
and publications include over 27 peer-reviewed research papers, two patents, a Facebook Graduate Fellowship, LEGO
Foundation sponsored research, and was a finalist of the Innovation by Design Awards. She also received the Scent
Innovator Award by CEW and IFF. Website: [judithamores.com](judithamores.com)

#### Hsin-Ni Ho
Hsin-Ni Ho is an Associate Professor in the Faculty of Design at Kyushu University, Japan. Her research interests
include haptic perception, multimodal interactions, shitsukan (material quality) perception, and the development of
haptic interfaces based on human perceptual properties. Hsin-Ni received her Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2006 and worked as a research scientist in the NTT Communication Science
Laboratories, Japan, from 2007 to 2021. Website: [sites.google.com/view/hohapticslab](sites.google.com/view/hohapticslab)

#### Masahiko Inami
Masahiko Inami is a Professor at the University of Tokyo whose research asks, “What are the challenges in creating
interfaces that allow users to act and express their intentions intuitively?” Today’s computer systems are limited: they
only exploit visual and auditory sensations. However, daily life uses a variety of modalities, including some that come
in direct contact with our bodies. These later modalities can dramatically affect our ability to experience and express
ourselves. Masahiko designs a new generation of Human-Computer Integrated systems informed by modern
physiological understandings of sensation and perception, emerging electronic devices, and agile computational
methods. Website: [star.rcast.u-tokyo.ac.jp](star.rcast.u-tokyo.ac.jp)

#### Simon Niedenthal
Simon Niedenthal is an Associate Professor of Interaction Design at Malmö University, Sweden. His research
focuses upon olfactory interaction, game aesthetics, and the sensory dimensions of gameplay. Recent projects include
Nosewise, a collaboration with psychologists at Stockholm University exploring the potentials of smell training, and
Exerscent, an open source, low-cost olfactory interface for remote olfactory assessment and training. In 2008, Simon
defended his Ph.D. thesis Complicated Shadows: The Aesthetic Significance of Simulated Illumination in Digital Games, on
game lighting and its effect on the emotions and behavior of the player. Website: Google Scholar

#### Jessica Lai
Jessica Lai is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Engineering and Design and the Department of Arts at Arizona
State University. Her interests lie at the intersection of electrical engineering and visual arts, focusing on human-
computer interaction, virtual reality, and olfaction. Her most recent work was a flexible software-hardware
infrastructure for producing spatially sensitive and programmable odors. She is working to further her insights in this
realm while developing an artistic and scientific virtual reality experience about the senses through a journey to Mars.

#### Mason Manetta
Mason Manetta is an Electrical Engineering undergraduate researcher at Arizona State University’s Meteor Studio.
Mason focuses on researching and developing odor-producing computer interfaces for multimodal experiences. Their
most recent device enabled spatial smell perception in virtual reality. Additionally, Mason investigates energy-efficient
architectures for mobile and embedded image capture and medical imaging methods, particularly electrical impedance
tomography. Mason has published work at IEEE VR and MobiSys, which have been covered in media articles by ASU
and KJZZ public radio. Mason plans to pursue a doctoral degree. Website: [mcmanetta.github.io](mcmanetta.github.io)

#### Lauryn Mannigel
Lauryn Mannigel is an artist-researcher and curator based in Tempe (U.S.) and Berlin (D.E.). She is a Ph.D. student
in the Media Arts and Sciences program at Arizona State University. Since 2005, Mannigel has been tackling the issue
of the Western cultural dominance of visual aesthetics and epistemology by exploring primarily non-visual sensory
perception through diverse media technologies. Since 2015, Mannigel’s primary research interest has focused on the
political potential of smell. She exhibited artwork and spoke at conferences worldwide. Website: [laurynmannigel.me](laurynmannigel.me)
